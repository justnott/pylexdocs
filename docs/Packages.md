# Installing Packages

## Step 1
Open your server's page

## Step 2
Locate the startup tab at the top bar of your server's page.

## Step 3
Inside of the startup tab, locate the "Additional Node packages" text box. This may appear different depending on which [egg](https://docs.coopr.tech/docs/Egg) your server is running on.

## Step 4
Without typing in `npm install` or `pip install`, type in the packages that would go in the install command. Use spaces to separate each one.

You only have to put this in once.

## Step 5
Once you have completed every other step, start your server. You should see the CPU usage get a little high, and nothing in your console/terminal. Wait a few moments while your container does the internet magic, and there you have it!

Once your server is up and running, the packages have been installed successfully.
