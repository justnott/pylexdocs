Last edited by justnott on November 4, 2024

The Abooz Bot (AKA Abuse Bot) is a Pylex created and hosted Discord bot that detects abuse within the free infrastructure.

## What are some triggers to Abooz Bot?

The main triggers publicly visible are as follows:

- Average of over 15% vCPU for 60 seconds
- Average of over 500MB/minute Inbound network
- Average of over 500MB/minute Outbound network
- Suspicious Internet requests
- High (undefined) RAM usage

## What is the Abooz Bot for?

Unfortunately, some people decide to break simple rules that were put in place. Most of the time, Abooz Bot blocks Discord [selfbots](https://docs.coopr.tech/docs/SelfBot), ROBLOX PIN crackers, and more. This is to ensure the experience is smooth, and satisfying to other users.

## How can I avoid Abooz Bot?

If you are using Pylex as a normal customer, you shouldn't have to worry about anything. Otherwise, if you know your server is CPU heavy, consider upgrading to a [Premium](https://docs.coopr.tech/#1213-pylex-pro-panel) plan!
