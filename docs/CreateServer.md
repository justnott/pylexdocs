Login to the client if you haven't already.

Remember to click authorize when the Discord page opens.

## Step 3
On the side bar, look for the "Create a new server" button. (Highlighted in the photo)

## Step 4
Create a name for your server! This can be anything you want, and is only visible to you!

Similarly, you can choose what [egg](https://docs.coopr.tech/docs/Egg) you want your server to use.

If the create server button at the bottom doesn't work, try clicking Free again, or the egg again.

## Step 5
Et voila!

Your new server will be ready in about 1-2 minutes! Then, you can go straight to your new game hosting server!
